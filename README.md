# YouTube subscriptions dashboard - ALPHA

A custom YouTube subscriptions dashboard allowing you to view the latest videos of your favorite channels.
The project is far from done and mainly created for personal use, however it will become fully customizable 
when it's first proper release is ready.

You can check out a demo on my website: https://www.fabianwennink.nl/projects/youtube/

## Running it yourself
First generate your API key over at https://console.developers.google.com (select YouTube Data API v3).  

Next, run `npm install` to install the dependencies, and use `npm start` to build the project and launch a local server.
